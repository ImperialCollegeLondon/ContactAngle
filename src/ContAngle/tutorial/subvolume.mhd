//! ### Format Specifications:
//! All keyword data should be provided in a single line.
//! 
//! The first unrecognised keyword together with the rest of the file will
//! be ignored. 


//! DNS/PNM codes can read .am, .tif, .raw.gz, .raw and .txt/.dat files. 
//! The format is detected from the image suffix in ElementDataFile keyword.

//! When the image format is .raw or .raw.gz, this file can be opened in 
//! ImageJ/Fiji or Paraview to load the image.  For tif images, you should
//! open the .tif file directly.

//! When using .raw.gz, .raw and the image is not UChar and not written 
//! in little-endian, add the following keyword before the ElementDataFile:
//!  ElementByteOrderMSB = True

//! When using .raw.gz image files, for compatibility with Fiji/Paraview, add
//! the following keyword before the ElementDataFile:
//!   CompressedData = True


//! = is used only in the standard mhd keywords (the first 10 lines) but
//! not in the DNS/PNM commands and keywords.

//! When the image is in .tif format, all the keywords can be dropped, but 
//! to ensure the voxel-size is correct the keywords ElementSize and
//! Offset can be provided to override those read from .tif tags. 
//! In .tif format, the keyword DimSize is redundant and hence ignored.

//! lines BEGINING with "#" and "//" are considered as comments and skipped, 
//! but no comment is allowed before the keyword ElementDataFile.

//! A syntax highlighting hack: associate the .mhd suffix with C++: 
//! In geany in "Tools -> Configuration files -> filetype_extensions.conf"
//! or by menu "Document -> Set Filetype -> Programming Languages -> C++".



//! Hint: setting `ElementSize = 1 1 1` and `Unit = 1` means that 
//! cuvratures in ContactAngle code will have a unit of 1/voxelLength
