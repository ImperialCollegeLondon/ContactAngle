 ----------------------------------------------------------------    

This is a fork of https://github.com/AhmedAlratrout/ContactAngle-Curvature-Roughness (2017).
The code is restructured and built on top of a more recent libvoxel (version 2020) library and foam3xm -- minified (open)foam-extend library.
This simplifies installation by removng the dependancy on official openfoam.
Additionally it provides further flexibility on the input image format through the use of the [libvoxel](src/libvoxel) library.
The algorithms, however, are kept identical to the original code.
